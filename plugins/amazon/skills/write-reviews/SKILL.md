# Write Reviews

Draft or submit Amazon product reviews from purchased items.

## Requirements Gate

Before drafting or browser automation, ask directly for any missing review inputs:

- Product or order to review
- Rating or sentiment
- Main pros, cons, use case, and time used
- Whether the user wants a draft only or wants help submitting after review

If the user already supplied enough inputs, proceed.

## Browser Access

Use the normal signed-in browser surface available in the current environment when verifying purchased-item context or opening the Amazon review form.

## Workflow

1. Identify the product or order being reviewed.
2. Verify purchase context when possible from the product page, order history, or review form.
3. Draft a concise, specific review grounded in the user's experience.
4. If the user wants submission help, place the draft in the review form and stop for explicit approval before submitting.
5. Submit only after the user confirms the final visible review content and rating.

Read [references/review-workflow.md](references/review-workflow.md) for review-form paths, draft guidance, submission confirmation, and recovery steps.

## Account Actions

Do not submit, edit, or delete a review unless the user explicitly approves that exact action after seeing the final content. Drafting is allowed without submission approval.

## Output Rules

- For drafts, provide the review text and a suggested star rating if requested.
- For browser-assisted submissions, report whether the review was drafted, submitted, or blocked.
- After approved submission, verify the final submitted or thank-you state before saying it was submitted.
